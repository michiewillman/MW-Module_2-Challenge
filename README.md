# Michie Willman | Module 2 Challenge

## Project Description

This project was creating a digital resume and portfolio so that potential future employers and recruiters can view my work online. We were required to create a webpage from scratch using HTML, anad style it using CSS.

The page meets the following requirements:

```
My name, a recent photo, and links to sections about me, my work, and how to contact me.
The UI scrolls to the corresponding section when you click one of the links in the navigation.
The UI scrolls to a section with titled images of my applications when you click on the link to the section about my work.
When you are presented with my first application, that application's image is larger in size than the others.
When you click on the images of the applications, you are taken to that deployed application (links will be replaced later when they are completed).
When you resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices, there is a responsive layout that adapts to your viewport.
```
